### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

Practicing React and using the picture tag

### Continued development

I need to improve on looking at the details in the design before pushing

### Useful resources

- [A Guide to the Responsive IMages Syntax in HTML](https://css-tricks.com/a-guide-to-the-responsive-images-syntax-in-html/#using-picture) - I always come back to this website to review the picture tag.
